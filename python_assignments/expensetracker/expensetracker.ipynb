    "# Assignment – 2 Expense Tracker Using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overview:\n",
    "# In this project, you will build a simple expense tracker application that allows users to record daily\n",
    "# expenses, categorize them, and generate spending reports. You willmaster Python programming\n",
    "# concepts such as data structures, control structures, and functions. Key tasks include user authentication,\n",
    "# expense management, and report generation. You will implement features like user log in, expense\n",
    "# categorization, and CSV export, gaining real-world Python development experiencewith a focus on error\n",
    "# handling, data validation, and userinteraction.\n",
    "# Instructions:\n",
    "# • Review the learning materials in Fundamentals of Python Programming\n",
    "# • Carefully read the situation, tasks, actions, and results in sections to graspthe assignment fully\n",
    "# • Complete and submit your assignment through the Learning ManagementSystem (LMS)\n",
    "# • Follow the provided guidelines closely, ensuring your report includes all\n",
    "# • required analyses and interpretations\n",
    "# Situation:\n",
    "# As part of your role in a financial services company, you are tasked with developing a Python project to\n",
    "# create a robust expense tracker application for the organization.This application will enable users to record\n",
    "# and categorize daily expenses and generate comprehensive reports to analyze spending habits. The system\n",
    "# should include features such as user authentication and efficient expense management, providing valuable\n",
    "# insights for personal and corporate financial planning.\n",
    "# Task:\n",
    "# As a Python developer, you are tasked to create an expense tracker application that helps users manage and\n",
    "# analyze their daily expenses by providing functionalities for expense management, user authentication, and\n",
    "# reporting.\n",
    "# Action:\n",
    "# 1. Open the Python environment:\n",
    "# a. Open the Python practice lab and start your work in a blank code file.\n",
    "# 2. Create Classes and Methods:\n",
    "# a. Define a class named Expense to represent an expense record\n",
    "# b. Use the __init__ method to initialize an expense object with the following attributes:\n",
    "# i. expense_id: A unique identifier for the expense\n",
    "# ii. date: The date of the expense\n",
    "# iii. category: The category of the expense (e.g., food, transportation)\n",
    "# iv. description: A brief description of the expense\n",
    "# v. amount: The amount spent\n",
    "# c. Define the __str__ method to return the string representation of the expense object\n",
    "# 3. Data Storage:\n",
    "# a. Create an empty list named expenses to store expense records\n",
    "# b. Define the following functions to manipulate the list:\n",
    "# i. add_expense(expense): Adds a new expense object to the list\n",
    "# ii. update_expense(expense_id, new_expense): Updates an existing expense object\n",
    "# based on expense_id\n",
    "# iii. delete_expense(expense_id): Deletes an expense object from the list based on\n",
    "# expense_id\n",
    "# iv. display_expenses(): Displays all expense objects in the list\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. User Authentication:\n",
    "# a. Create a dictionary named users with predefined usernames and passwords\n",
    "\n",
    "# b. Define the function authenticate_user(username, password).\n",
    "# This function will:\n",
    "# i. Check if the provided username exists in the user's dictionary\n",
    "# ii. Verify if the provided password matches the password in the user dictionary\n",
    "# iii. Print a success message if authentication is successful; otherwise, print a failure\n",
    "# message\n",
    "# iv. Return True if authentication is successful, otherwise returns False\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. Categorization and Summarization:\n",
    "# a. Define the function categorize_expenses(). This function will:\n",
    "# i. Create an empty dictionary named categories\n",
    "# ii. Iterate over each expense in the expenses list\n",
    "# iii. Add the expense amount to the corresponding category in the categories dictionary\n",
    "# iv. Return the categories dictionary\n",
    "# b. Define the function summarize_expenses(). This function will:\n",
    "# i. Initialize a variable total to 0\n",
    "# ii. Iterate over each expense in the expenses list and add the expense amount to total\n",
    "# iii. Return the total sum of expenses\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Functions for Repetitive Tasks:\n",
    "# a. Define the function calculate_total_expenses():\n",
    "# i. Use a generator expression to sum the amount of all expenses in the expenses list\n",
    "# ii. Return the total sum of expenses\n",
    "# b. Define the function generate_summary_report():\n",
    "# i. Call categorize_expenses() to get the categorized expenses\n",
    "# ii. Print the total amount for each category\n",
    "# iii. Print the total sum of all expenses by calling calculate_total_expenses()\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. Simple CLI for Interaction:\n",
    "# a. Define the function cli () to provide a menu for user interaction:\n",
    "# i. Print the menu options\n",
    "# ii. Take user input to select an option\n",
    "# iii. Write if-Elif conditions to execute the corresponding function based on user input:\n",
    "# 1. Adds a new expense\n",
    "# 2. Updates an existing expense\n",
    "# 3. Deletes an expense\n",
    "# 4. Displays all expenses\n",
    "# 5. Generates a summary report\n",
    "# 6. Exits the application\n",
    "\n",
    "# b. Call the authenticate_user() function before showing the menu to ensure the user is\n",
    "# authenticated\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. Run the program and verify the results:\n",
    "# a. Run the program by executing the file in your Python environment\n",
    "# b. Follow the prompts and inputs to simulate user interactions and admin functions\n",
    "\n",
    "# Result:\n",
    "# By completing this project, you have developed a functional expense tracker application that supports user\n",
    "# authentication, expense management, and reporting. To build a real-world application, you have gained\n",
    "# practical experience in applying fundamental Python programming concepts, including data structures, control\n",
    "# structures, and functions. This project has prepared you for more advanced projects and professional work in\n",
    "# Python development. Save and submit your solution file (.ipynb file format) in LMS."
